## Getting Started With Manavta

This project is a demo created to showcase how Manavta Healthcare Framework can be utilized to create custom application.
To get this app up and running you need to create a "secret_keys.dart" file inside the lib folder.
 
 And add the following : -
 
library secretkeys; 

const GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID_HERE";

const GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET_HERE";

Both of these must be replaced by your codes issued by Github-Developer console.

After the above steps add this app to your firebase console and register your app.
